\begin{abstract}
The aim of this master thesis is the development of a multiagent model for a simulation  of two populations whose interactions are strongly influenced by a realistic landscape.
This research will be in line with Consolider-Simulpast (www.simulpast.es), an interdisciplinary project aimed to create simulations designed to be used in archaeological studies of human-environment interaction, decision-making processes and coevolutionary/competition behaviours of past societies.
The work plan will be focused on the development of first-stage models for two societies in the age of agriculture spreading surpasing the hunting and foraging way of living. The simulation will involve a climate engine for seasonality depending primarily on variable rainfall rate. Landscape information will be created from satellite image rasters. Constants, and variable relationship shall be modelled from measures and interviews with the experts. Data analysis tasks will be undertaken to validate the models and detect patterns in the archaeological record. Furthermore a comparison will be stablished between the classical simple models used in social simulation[1][2][8] and more advanced approaches.

\section{Motivation}

Simulation has been following an evolution in the models and paradigms applied to represent its target
systems. Dynamical systems, differential equations have been used and an overall simplification of the parts of the systems in the history of simulation to operate with the abstraction and simplification of the problems.
Mainly, reusing ideas from physical simulations, social sciences has modelled complex systems with dynamical
atomic entities that apply a simple set of centralized rules to move around the environment modelled. It was seen that due to the deeper details in human behaviour the question that could be solved and asked to that kind of models could not go very further as expected. 

To solve non-linearity phenomena, heterogeneity, hysteressis and other issues typical of complex systems, Agent Based Models(ABMs) where introduced to gain more insight of the modelled systems achieving good results. But under 
some conditions of very complex relationships between agents, highly specialized decission taking procedures
and issues in the environment led agents to need a sophysticated reasoning and problem solving capabilities
that are not specified and not yet introduced in ABMs coming from Social Sciences. 

We have found an example of that situation in our case study located in Gujarat from Simulpast project. Our agents must interact with a regular but changing environment to get resources, plan its actions, coordinate with its group and compete with other groups in a \textbf{co-evolution} dynamic. Because we want to find out why the Gujarat HunterGatherer(HG) way of life lasted more than in other place of Earth in its competition against AgroPastoralist(AP), we need to embed the behaviours of the survival strategies used by these groups. A simply reactive agent cannot cope with short term plus long term decissions in that competitive environment. So the question stated as topic for this Master Thesis project is \textbf{``do we get better results in social sciences simulations adding deeper AI techniques to make richer the behaviour or decission making engines of the entities in the system?''}. As we understand ``better results``, the outcome from the use of AI should be a more sound validation of the model, a nearier match of modelled behaviours with the real ones, and clearer, richer and robust scientific conclusions.

In order to study such posibilities Sugarscape[SugarScape] is a good framework to extend. Sugarscape is an artificial society developed by Joshua Epstein et al[Epstein]. where a number of inhabitants move to collect resources they need to live. Sugarscape models perception, lattice scanning in search of resources, sexual reproduction of the agents in the simulation, market relationships, immunology and spreading of diseases, and feature evolution. Epstein analises different experiments executed in the Sugarscape offering his conclusions and the dynamics emerging from the simulations. The results and conclusions will feed our AI experiments in order to make the comparisons of classical SugarScape agents vs AI agents, therefore, giving an answer to the topic of the Master Project.

\section{Simulation}

%brief description
%hi ha altres aplicacions de simulacio on no hi ha component temporal i no ho estic esmentant! MonteCarlo,etc...
Simulation is a discipline for performing virtual experiments in a computer. Computational techniques are used to build a model that represents your system. The dynamics of that system is codified in an algorithm that computes a calculus imitating the changes of state in the model, hence having a representation of that change along the time of the system modelled. Simulate is to play to ''what happens if...?'', and it is aimed to discover and explain the dynamics of a system to enhace or guide strategy development, decission taking, management, solving problems without analytical solutions or knowledge discovering and research. Although, we could get other positive benefits from it like theory checking or training through the inmersion in virtual worlds responding to our input.

% purpose, a priori, outcome,  { deduction, induction, abduction(Alexis) } Axelrod's
% crec que els agradara, marketing, saborcillo de IA impregnant els racons
A simulation obeys some direction of experimentation, so a question must be set to drive the selection of features to model from the real system and give a direction to the modelling and the experiments design.These assumptions choice will prune the details not related to the questions to solve. It is not just for the sake of simplicity but for the practical reason that a model too near of the real system will be as hard as the original system to analyse.\\
Simulation, like deduction, starts with a set of those explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, it does not prove theorems. Instead, a simulation generates data that can be analysed inductively. Unlike typical induction, however, the simulated data comes from a rigorously specified artificial experiment rather than direct measurement of the real world. While induction can be used to find patterns in data, and deduction can be used to find consequences of assumptions, simulation modeling can be used as an aid intuition and hypothesis validation tool ( also as space search mechanism for parameter tunning or optimization ).
%abduction
Just like in a tipical Sherlock Holmes adventure you pick the evidences, scenario for the experiment, and the common knowledge (initial expert assumptions about the model). You enter in a refinement cycle where you test hypothesis and readjust them to discover the theory, the ``plot``, the explanation of what is happening.

Social simulation is a research field that applies computational methods to study issues in the social sciences. The issues explored include problems in psychology, sociology, political science, economics, anthropology, geography, archaeology and linguistics \cite{TakahashiSallachRouchier2007}.\\
Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the hard sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.\\
In social simulation, computers supports human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as complex non-linear systems, which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models.
%reducibility 
Most of the times, studying complex systems implies to cope with non reducibility. One of the examples is Gravitational Dynamics. If our assumption is the use of Newton's mechanics, we can predict the state at any time or not, depending on the scenario. For a one dimension world you can predict the state at time $t_n$ from the initial state $t_0$ without computing all the preceding ones. For two and more dimensions you can only compute directly state $t_n$ if less the three bodies are implied. So in a real environment of many bodies in a 3D world you need to compute all the states from the initial to the one you consider as the last one. The system is non analytically reducible and you are forced to apply simulation to visit all the states and develop the behaviour of the model. It happens in most of the complex systems models, they have a nonlinear specification. Nonlinear models do not have a simple or computational reasonable analytical solution. 
% ( Classical Physics formulae used are non linear, acceleration is a quadratic factor in position <-- revisa aquesta fantasmada ) 

%emergence
Other of the main issues in complex systems simulation is emergence. While the initial assumptions may be simple, the consequences may not be at all obvious. The large-scale effects of locally interacting entities are called "emergent properties" of the system. Emergent properties are often surprising because it can be hard to anticipate the full consequences of even simple forms of interaction. 

%why simulation? because I need this non deducible emergence and the non deducible end state
There are some models, however, in which emergent properties can be formally deduced. Good examples include the neo-classical economic models in which rational agents operating under powerful assumptions about the availability of information and the capability to optimize can achieve an efficient reallocation of resources among themselves through costless trading. But when the agents use \textbf{adaptive} rather than optimizing strategies, deducing the consequences is often impossible; simulation becomes necessary.

\section{Question} 

% trobo a faltar m\'es xixa te\`orica, aix\`o s'hauria de semblar m\'es a un cap\'itol del Norvig.
In classical simulation approaches, specifically in the branch of Social Simulation, active entities which model human actors are designed with very simple behaviour engines. The classical hypothesis is that a complex mind for entities in the simulation are not that needed and maybe even could lead to difficult analysis of final results of the simulations (too daring statement?). 

Our statement is that, on the contrary, the mind engine of a simulation entity should not be bounded to that limit but special attention must be paid to give any necessary sofistication to give the entity a correct behaviour, real enough, sensible to the changes in the environment and competent to solve the issues that will have to solve along its lifetime in the system. Even more, we think that this entities' capability to respond with complex behaviours is the core that roots the modelling granularity needed to catch the essential of the social systems that we want to model.( a l'apartat de ABMs ho tornem a dir perÃƒÂ² afegint que cal adaptabilitat, resposta no lineal, aprenentatge depenent del temps, histeresis,...).\\
( i aixo motivaria els ABMs) Applying such premises we will explore the possibility to give or enhance decission
making, problem solving capabilities to the entities with the aim to get more accurate simulations and realistic models with higher matching against our job hypothesis and premises. We will take the framework of ABMs to integrate the AI techniques in a decission making schema of action-response dynamics sensible to a modelled world(por los pelos...).\\

%que es modelling en ciencies socials 
\\

%%% XR
%%Computer modelling and complex systems simulation have dominated the scientific debate over the last decade, %%providing important outcomes in biology, geology and life sciences, and resulting in the birth of entirely new %%disciplines (e.g. bioinformatics, geoinformatics, health informatics, etc.). In the social sciences, the number of groups currently developing research programs in this direction is increasing. The results are extremely promising since simulation technologies have the potential to become an essential tool in the field \cite{Gilbert2008}.\\
%%However, some social scientists are sceptical about the idea of reproducing â€œinsideâ€ a computer population dynamics, because of the perceived complexity of social structures. This scepticism is understandable given the low number of projects that used this approach and the lack of experience of social scientists with these tools. Nevertheless, the research done in complexity science during recent years shows the way computer simulation can be applied to this field. Artificial intelligence portrays how the appropriate interconnection of very simple computational mechanisms is able to show extraordinary complex patterns, and access to distributed computing has become affordable. For this reason, agent-based simulation allows the implementation of experiments and studies that would not be viable otherwise \cite{Pavon2008}. \\

% ATM mini intro
Modelling is a widely extended methodology. It comes from the natural observation of the world and the curiosity or need to reproduce it.\\
Modelling will be our framework for communication between archeologists' and sociologists' knowledge and their conceptualizations with our formal representations from computer science practices( simulation, algorithms, AI ).
The reason is that it is a procedure that will help to communicate the \textbf{discursive} nature of Social Sciences with the formal structures from Computer Science. The enginering of model development will allow us to reach a connection from experts' knowledge to a model that comprises the set of detail clearing out the ambiguity that language could filtrate. Also, the model development cycle will help set a picture of the system without inconsistencies, with each fact sound,  coherent and consistent from the logical point of view with the whole. 

\section{Why model}

% ATM, que es modelar? i com es modela?
The modelling process consists in identifying separable entities, processes, relationships and any rellevant information related to the question to solve and the domain of study. Indeed just thinking about something implies an unconscious projection of our mental frame hence producing a set of concepts and relationships that give birth to a model. The missed step is that it was not made explicit through some formal representation. A model is a logical and conceptual prototipe.
As Epstein \cite{Epstein2008} says \textit{â€œAnyone who ventures a projection, or imagines how a social dynamicâ€”an epidemic, war, or migrationâ€”would unfold is running some modelâ€}.\\

Modelling is an introspection exercise where you take into account the domain to elaborate a \textbf{formal} representation of the conceptualizations you develop around the problem. Mainly, it will have to do with mathematical expressions from calculus or algebra and logics. That is called \textbf{conceptual modelling}. This phase comprises the development of a relevant simplification, which must be complete according to the phenomena that inspires the question. Anything left out will change the outcome of the simulation, and non-relevant added items will produce noise that will difficult posterior analisys. All the involved facts must be correctly well grounded taking into account that any unneeded compound in the model will also be added to the scientific and mathematic justification, adding good-for-nothing effort. \\

For instance, I am modelling the dynamics of a restaurant to find an optimum allocation of waiters between interior and terrace tables and their serving policy, so I could minimize hired waiters while lowering the waiting time of clients. Variables like client arrival rate, kitchen serving time, number of interior tables, number of terrace tables are reasonable parts of the system to add to the simplification. The colour of the courtains, the outfit of the waiters most probably will not account for the stated optimization objective. Someone could argue about the topology of the tables whether it should be added or not to the model. But if I would model the system to analyze the survival rate when there is a fire and people must exit from the building as soon as possible, table and furniture topology is an unquestionable variable.\\

This kind of criteria should lead to a preference for simpler models. There are many reasons which force to design consciously with this premise. More complex models require harder effort to work their credibility, verification for the correct implementation of the conceptual model, and from the formal point of view, validation of the model and the scientific conclussions. Considering the system conceptualization and formalization, a more complex model is more open to criticism for the objective or subjective choice of features and modelling decisions. Why the present features were chosen and the missing ones were left out? why one expert point of view, and not other one? Also, as Robinson \cite{Robinson2008} states, simple models have many advantages, such as they are faster, require less data, are more flexible and, more importantly, if we better understand them we can better interpret their results. The KISS Lemma sumarizes it ``Keep It Simple, Stupid''.\\

% ATM:aqui o mes endevant? aprofondir molt?
Another concern is that detail and granularity choice is attached to the overall direction that takes the construction of the model in terms of structure. At this point it is interesting to mention how does a model can be grown.\\
The theory describes the domain as an ontological corpus of interelated conceptualizations where the pieces of knowledge can be related with equal to equal or relationships of subsumption and hierarchical connection. Following the distribution induced by such hierarchy the space of conceptualizations of the theory will have bounds in the higher and deeper concepts found in the top and bottom locations of the hierarchy. Usually, modelling methodology takes either the top, bottom or a midle layer to crystalize the model following the hierarchy in a direction towards the higher concepts or the deeper. An ascending crystalization is called \textbf{bottom-up} and the inverse direction is known as \textbf{top-down}. Crystalization could begin in a midle layer and stop before arriving a top or bottom bound layer. But can also happen that the modelization requires go further the bound. For instance, consider we are modelling a society to see the emergence of some differentiated groups. We could model towns, neighbourhoods, go down to families and then arrive to the person. Maybe we would like to characterized persons to some inner features related to their personality; now we are entering in a layer belonging to psychology sciences, we have surpassed the bottom conceptualization in sociology. If we go further we could arrive to the brain structures entering the field of neurology. We could continue to mollecules, biochemistry, and so on and so forth.

%George Box
Although good modelling of the parts could be accomplished lefting out the non-relevant phenomena, citing the famous quote of George Box, essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.\\

% multidiscpl ATM
As said before, Social Sciences represent their knowledge in discursive texts using natural language. In our Gujarat project we are experiencing interaction between different disciplines of social sciences : anthropology, archeology, and sociology. Each one of these branches has its own terminology, target problems and argue their discurse with different structures. 
Besides having to cope with implicit ambiguity in each discursive knowledge, all these branches must cooperate in a common framework connecting the different used conceptualizations. Some branches can organize their knowledge in concepts of entities, other use processes or actions, for instance. We cannot collapse this frameworks directly in a formal model. The modelling process will ellicite this structures and will match them with the mathematical tools offered by the chosen paradigm( lets say Dynamical System Theory, Agent Based Models, Petri Nets ). We will translate the conceptualizations to a common language that will connect the formalizations in a whole, the \textbf{conceptual framework}.  
Modelling will help to find a consensus for expressing the concepts and properties, will help to ellicite knowledge, arrange ambiguities, detect common points. It will allow as to embed the needed rigor to work under the same framework to make every part work together ( aixo sona fatxa i centralista :P ). Modelling shall be an exercise of shared development that can approach positions and circle a communication problem to solve the issues that will arise.

%society/social sc descrip, 
Social Sciences study the outcome of the interaction of individuals, the behaviour of society or distinguishable
groups inditified in it. The study of society or social groups considers its target as a adaptative ecosystem of people with interaction, other living entities, environmental conditions or environmental dynamics, information
exchange and the mutual adaptative changes induced between the actors, co-evolution.

%modelling targets/items, 

Modelling societies implies being aware of constituents identified by the social theories. Interacting entities conform a society. Such entities are observed and abstracted from identifiable individuals, people, and activity units, for instance families, neighbourhoods or job partners, composed also of the same individuals. 
An individual leaves a trace of participations and interactions in the society. Such activities occur with other
individuals, with some activity units or through them. Populations of individuals flow through the social structures, selectively participating and differentially performing. 
Ordinary living involves a participation of people in the social activities of family, leisure and holidays, shopping, work and travel. Activity within a unit is structured by relationships and choices, rules, rituals and randomness. Ordinary living also involves the participation of cultural ideas and artefacts in social activities.\\
The social sciences seek to understand not only how individuals behave under the social influence, but also how the interaction of many individuals leads to large-scale outcomes and global phenomena. 
%%
The main issues observed, individuals, units, processes or actions, flow and dynamics within units, are the frontline of the modelization aspects and motivation for the different paradigms appeared or adapted to solve the modeling objectives. New knowledge to infer from this identified phenomena will be the \textbf{descriptive} statement of observed behaviour, quantitative empirical \textbf{generalisations}, construction or assesment of \textbf{theories} and \textbf{prediction} models.

%possible paradigms. TOASK : Explico mes que son sistemes dinamics i la resta d'opcions?????

The first paradigms to model social processes were borrowed from the fields of physics, operations research, and economics materialized as game theory. The first social concepts considered were those related to social units or subgroups and large processes. Also, due to the main use of dynamical systems and differential equations, social phenomena was modelled as a flow between different containers that represent groups or state of individuals.\\

\label{fig:SimTL}
\end{figure}

Richer representations to cope with reality led to nonlinear specifications and the introduction of heterogeneity present in social systems making them hard to represent or analitically unsolvable, hence, the following years saw the spreading of \textbf{simulation techniques}, first AI aproximations, cellular automatas and Petri's networks that allowed a finer granularity going from the top abstract groupings infered in social theories to the individual entities.\\

Gradually social modelling began to approach computational sciences keeping its connections to mathematics and statistics. Programming languages are more expressive, less abstract than most mathematical techniques. Programs deal more easily with parallel processes and processes without a well-defined order of actions compared to math equations. There is a quite long experience on studying programs and their properties from Algorithmics, Soft Engineering, and Operating Systems. The enginering of big models benefits from these branches endowing them with the desirable properties of modularity, extendibility, the experience of combining programs to grow huge program systems, error detection and maintenance, to mention some.

This last improvement and the use of MultiAgent Modelling in social modelling allowed to introduce the bottom layer of the hierarchy of concepts of social science, \textbf{people} and all the package of phenomena and issues associated to it. Once you are modelling a person you can work directly with personal or social relationships and their properties, arity, creation and destruction mechanisms, transitivity and interaction rules. This allows to solve models non solved before, like some cooperation, coordination and competition scenarios from game theory where several agents are involved, for instance. Also the direct interaction and feedback effects between the entities and the  environment can be represented in the model. Before this step, other paradigms could not cope with the intrinsic phenomena of people interacting in a social scenario. Different issues had to be modelled, agent decission process modelling and embedding of the Rational Choice Theory, heterogeneity in the entitites, bounded rationality, and complex psychology.\\ 
Modelling from a bottom-up point of view with the inclusion of agents will allow to be near the real causes of macroscopic large scale phenomena non predicted from the microscopic local issues. Complex systems theory calls this \textbf{emergence}.
A further section will describe this effect.

%% definition
Multi Agent System(MAS) is an architecture for software development based on designing a solution for a problem that 
executes of a set of computational entities called agents that interact themselves in a defined environment.\\
Such entities are active decission making actors in the modelled system. The modelling lifecycle of an MAS will consider a stage where decission making processes must be identified from the system. Usually that decission making 
actions are carried along by more or less clear individual entities from the system. The modelling process will take the task to set the matching between these entities and the agent that will conform the MAS. The concept 
'' agent '' condenses a set of features that will specify the modelling metaphor that an agent represents:
some enclosed set of mechanisms to be aware of the state of the system, a set of goals to accomplish and the engine to decide from a bounded perception of the world, the actions to apply on it to achieve these goals. Besides the reasoning component of the agents, MASs have a strong component of inter-agent relationship. How one agent interacts with other agents could as important or more as how it reacts to world changes.

An agent is a computer system that is capable of independent action on behalf of its user or owner,
figuring out what needs to be done to satisfy design objectives, rather than constantly being told.
An agent solves problems applying iteratively the schema of sense, decide and act continously. Each
of the steps can add new targets to fulfill which will keep the agent exploring the environment and 
interacting with it and other agents to develop its strategies to solve the tasks and achieve goals.

An example of a very simple agent would be a thermostat. It samples the environment with a probe/sensor, 
checks if the temperature corresponds to the target. According to the measure it launches one of the two 
actions, to set the heater to ON or to OFF.\\
But we could have something as complex as an agent representing a car in a traffic simulation while drives 
from one point to another in the city. The agent would have accesible a knowledge base of traffic rules 
constraining its actions. The agent at each time step of the simulation would control the swarm of other 
vehicles to avoid collisions and would follow paths and perform actions coherent to the rules of traffic. 
The traffic rules would act as middle interface consensus of fair driving that coordinates all the cars 
and allows some prediction of the adjacent cars. The agent can be designed a step further. When congestion 
increases to a predefined threshold, which could be tuned through authomatic learning, the agent recalculates 
the route to adapt and avoid the traffic jam.\\
Intelligent agent design considers the setting of Perceptions, Actions, Goals and Environment. These
aspects conform a general structure where an agent design can grow. Mentioning an example considering a 
system that simulates hunting practices from ancient cultures will show how features from the agent are 
attached to these modules in the structure(table \ref{tab:hunterAgentSetting}).\\

%%\subsubsection{Agent Architecture Specification}

\paragraph{Agent formal description}
	
Let E be an environment with a finite set of states 
\begin{equation}
	\Omega = \{\omega_0,\omega_1,\ldots \}
\end{equation}
Each agent has available a set of actions 
\begin{equation}
	A = \{ \alpha_0, \alpha_1, \ldots \} 
\end{equation}
An action is a function that changes the state of the environment 
\begin{equation}
	\alpha_i : \Omega \longrightarrow \Omega 
\end{equation}
An agent's run is a sequence of states of the environment where the transitions were triggered 
by actions launched by the agent. Let $R$ be the set of all possible runs over $\Omega$ and $A$, and
$r^{u}$ one sequence of length $u$.
\begin{equation}
	r^{u} = ( \omega_0 , \alpha_0 , \omega_1 , \alpha_1 ,\ldots, \omega_{u-1} , \alpha_{u-1} , \omega_u )
\end{equation}
Let $R^{A}$ the sequences that end with an action 
\begin{equation}
	r^{u-1}_{A} = ( \omega_0 , \alpha_0 , \omega_1 , \alpha_1 ,\ldots, \omega_{u-1} , \alpha_{u-1} )
\end{equation}
Let $R^{\Omega}$ the sequences that end with an environment state 
\begin{equation}
	r^{u}_{\Omega} = ( \omega_0 , \alpha_0 , \omega_1 , \alpha_1 ,\ldots, \omega_{u-1} , \alpha_{u-1} , \omega_u )
\end{equation}
Actions in the run are the response of an agent $X_i$ to the states of the environment
\begin{equation}
	\forall j \in [0..u-1] : X_i(r^{j}_{\Omega}) = \alpha_j
\end{equation}
An stochastic and historic dependent environment behaviour, $\Tau$, can be described as
\begin{equation}
	\tau : R^{A} \longrightarrow \wp(\Omega)
\end{equation}
A Markovian environment behaviour would be defined as
\begin{equation}
	\tau : \Omega,A \longrightarrow \wp(\Omega)
\end{equation}
and the next would hold for the runs
\begin{equation} 
	\forall i \in [0..u-1] : \tau(\omega_i, \alpha_i) = \omega_{i+1}
\end{equation}
Let's say that no end condition is described for the runs here because althought it could happen
$\tau(\omega_i, \alpha_i) = \varnothing$, many other conditions could mark the end of a run.
For instance, a run can finish because the population of agents reaches 0 due to some dying process.
A run can also stop after a finite number of transitions, or some predefined event appears.\\
\\
An agent $X_i$ retrieves information from the history of environment states to choose an action to launch
\begin{equation}
	X_i : R^{\Omega} \longrightarrow A 
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Agent Main Behaviours}
\begin{description}
	\item [Autonomy] Other entities do not set the agent objectives nor decissions. With agents, 
	we give a high-level description of the delegated goal, and let the control mechanism figure
	out what to do, knowing that it will act in accordance with some built-in theory of rational 
	agency to satisfy it.

	\item [Reactivity] Response to environment stimulus or changes. A reactive agent is 
	one that maintains an ongoing interaction with its environment, and responds to changes 
	that occur in it (in time for the response to be useful). A pure reactive agent, the 
	thermostat can be formally descrived as
	\begin{equation}
		X_i : \Omega \longrightarrow A 
	\end{equation}
	\item [Proactivity] It means anticipation, taking initiative, detect oportunities. This
	could materialize in prediction of a future event an realize a set of a priori actions 
	before it occurs. For instance, if you are modelling a population of farmers and ... 
	It could mean that the agent produces a set of actions that trigger an environment event
	that will allow the execution of an action the approaches the agent to its goals.
	\item [Social capabilities] Cooperation, coordination, negotiation, competition, and mind models.
	Some objectives are not achievable by the only means of the agent. The agent must interact
	with other entities that can produce the chain of actions to produce the changes in the
	environment needed.
	%conflict
	Agents inhabit and intearact with the environment applying actions and producing effects
	in a same medium. Goals, effects and dynamics can clash. Is it possible the appearance of
	conflict. Goals and planned trend can be contradictory for more than one agent. According
	to the model of negotiation of the agent it can try to change its plan trying to not interfere
	with the other agents, or produce a deliberate interference or ignore it and stick to its
	objectives.
	Social capabilities will cover the spectrum of comunication but also integrate the other agents
	behaviour. Some sophisticated agents include mind models to add, predict the other agents' 
	behaviour in its knowledge representation engines.
	\begin{description}
		\item [Cooperation] Cooperation is working together as a team to achieve a shared goal.
		Often prompted either by the fact that no one agent can achieve the goal alone, or that 
		cooperation will obtain a better result (e.g., get result faster). That is very easy
		exemplified with hunt parties or some families of farmers that while one member takes care
		of the plot the other takes the cattle for grazing.

		\item [Coordination] Coordination is managing the interdependencies between activities.
		For example, if there is a non-sharable resource that you want to use and I want to use, 
		then we need to coordinate.

		\item [Negotiation] Negotiation is the ability to reach agreements on matters of common 
		interest. At the appearance of conflict a solution that benefits the parts is searched.
		For example: Two farmers arrive at a piece of land good for crop growing. A possible deal: split
		the land in two.Another solution : both work on the land, but each has assigned different
		tasks. By the end of the year they divide the harvest. Typically involves offer and 
		counter-offer, with compromises made by participants.

	\end{description}

	\item [Learning] Prediction for future situations,reuse solutions,avoid past errors. The agents stores
	patterns from the history of environment changes, or other agents' actions. The patterns conform a model
	of the world or of the task to perform used by the agent for future actions. As a detail, although the 
	learning could be produced in first stages of the run to produce benefits along the life of the agent,
	it is desirable that the learning should occur along all the run to produce a real adaptation of the 
	agent. The keyword is \textbf{incremental learning}.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Intelligent Agents Architecture}

This paragraph will show different decompositions of how an agent is structured 
and provide an answer to the question of how the sensor data and the current internal 
state of the agent determine the actions and future internal state of the agent.
The thermostat example contains an environment with a bounded and tractable number of states.
Such situations can be solved with a direct implementation setting the bijective function 
state - action with a table or with a limited number of rules.
As complexity of modelled systems grows, the number of states and possibilities become
untractable. Theres no time nor space to specify each correspondence. The agents apply different 
techniques for retrieving features  and structure from the environment to proceed with the
decission process from an abstraction to the action to perform (\cite{RussellNorvig}).  

\begin{description} %% we are interested in this division
	\item ?`Pure? Reactive Architectures

The decission process in Reactive Architectures selects actions only based on the last perception retrieved
from the environment. It does not considers any subset of past perceptions. Reactive Architectures encompass  
the Simple Reflex Agents.

A change in the environment provokes a response from the agent. When changes and deliberations in agent are
only motivated by an event in the environment, the agent is pure reactive.\\

	\item Deliberative Architectures

	A deliberative agent uses symbolic reasoning to deduce the action to launch. The deliberative agent
	contains explicitly the goal that steers its behaviour. Deliberation is done through an internal formal 
	representation of the state of the world, the state of the agent and other information retrieved by
	it. A logic engine will produce deductions from the facts stored in the agent memory, the knowledge
	base. The perceptions from the environment become facts to add to the internal representation of
	the environment. From this internal world model the agent can deduce trends for prediction besides
	the next action to launch. 
%%%
Some systems and agent behaviour must be described this way. -example-
A state of the environment or of the agent is specified. The agent must find the way to fulfill this within his reach of perceptions and actions.
Desirable situations are seeked → goals, seeked states of environment or agent.
Actions → satisfy goals non achievable from a single action execution: search + planning techniques
Goals could be a design feature of the agent (survive & reproduce), or could be set in runtime by conditions in the environment or through user commandment.
%%%%

	\begin{description} 
		\item [Logic] Deliberative agents will use assert clauses and structures to represent facts in 
		a logic of some level, CP0, CP1. Each new change in the knowledge base will allow to deduce
		new facts from the status of the system to check againts the goals and other issues the agent
		is considering to produce an action coherent with the planning and the mechanics of the environment
		to fulfill a new step to get nearer to the goals.
		%%TODO dibuix de la taula i els objectes mes la representacio interna : on(), above(),under()
		The agent will use its knowledge base as a theory of the world and things plus the dynamic facts
		that represent the volatile states.\\
		Let $\rho$ be a theory of the world. Depending on the architecture this can be a set of rules,
		or a learned structure along the run.\\ 
		If $\Gamma$ is a description for the current state of the world. $A$ the set of possible actions 
		\{$\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3$, \ldots\}. And $\Gamma \vdash_{\rho} \Phi$ stands for a succesful 
		prove that $\Phi$ is deduced from the knowledge base $\Gamma$ using theory $\rho$. The Deliberative 
		agent will choose actions according to a schema like that:

		\begin{algorithm}[H]
		\ForAll{$\alpha \in A$}{	
			\If{$\Gamma \vdash_{\rho} doAction(\alpha)$}{
				\Return $\alpha$;
			}
		}

		\ForAll{$\alpha \in A$}{	
			\If{$\Gamma \nvdash_{\rho} \neg doAction(\alpha)$}{
				\Return $\alpha$;
			}
		}
		\Return null;
		\end{algorithm}

		Asserts from Logic will be used to state the facts that are true from environment
		and the other agents.Knowledge representation. Solvers : Resolution, Forward/Backward chaining
		
		\item [BDI] Yoav Shoham introduced “agent-oriented programming” in 1990(\cite{Shoham1990}):“new 
		programming paradigm, based on a societal view of computation”. The key idea is about directly 
		programming agents in terms of \textbf{intentional} notions like belief, commitment, and intention.
		BDI belongs to a overloaded kind of logics called modal logics which add meta language operators to
		the facts to alter with some nuance the meaning or the semantic interpretation of the fact.
		For instance, let $\phi$ be a fact that could represent ``deer is in the wood''. Indeed it is true
		for the example. Our agent has not seen it and only has some clue that the deer is in the 
		wood; so the agent states $\Box_B \phi$, with an operator $\Box_B$ to indicate ``I believe the 
		deer is in the wood''. The memory of the agent will contain also the facts below
		\begin{description}
		\item[$\theta$] = ``I am hungry''.
		\item[$\eta$] = ``I go hunting''.
		\item [$\Box_D \eta$] = ``I have Desire for going hunting''.
		\item [$\Box_I \eta$] = ``I have Intention for going hunting''.
		\end{description}
		Some of these entail from other. They are governed by the next rules from the knowledge base
		\begin{itemize}
		\item myState(HUNGRY) 
			$\rightarrow$ $\Box_D$ doAction(HUNT)
		\item $\Box_D$ doAction(HUNT) $\wedge$ $\Box_B$ entityAtPlace($x$,$y$) $\wedge$ edible($x$) 
			$\rightarrow$ $\Box_I$ doAction(HUNT)
		\item $\Box_I$ doAction(HUNT) $\wedge$ $\Box_B$ entityAtPlace($x$,$y$) $\wedge$ edible($x$) 
			$\rightarrow$ doAction(go, $y$)
		\item entityAtPlace(MYSELF,$p$) $\wedge$ $\Box_I$ doAction(HUNT) $\wedge$ entityAtPlace($x$,$y$) $\wedge$ edible($x$) $\wedge$ distance($p$,$y$) $\leq$ HUNTDISTANCE	
			$\rightarrow$ doAction(HUNT,$x$)
		\item doAction($a$,$x$) $\rightarrow$ launchAction($a$($x$))
		\end{itemize}

		This rules would carry the agent to satisfy the goal of feeding going through the goal of going where the
		prey is, and see that it is indeed there where the agent believed.

		Programming agents this way allows a deeper description of the dynamics around the goals an agent 
		self-imposes and also an easier way for the agent to reason about the other agents. This last point
		crucial for a better integration of the social dynamics in the planning of goal achieving. The agent
		can construct through facts of Believing, Desire and Intention a mind model of the other models taking
		into account their BDI intentions and adapting to them to cooperate or compete. 

		Continuing the example, the agent would be inmersed in social deliberations after retrieving from the
		world facts like $\Box_{I}^i \eta$ that stand for ``Agent $i$ has the Intention of hunting''. The 
		interaction of all these facts, entityAtPlace(MYSELF,P), entityAtPlace($i$, P) will make deduce to the
		MYSELF agent somekind of communication protocol with agent $i$ to solve the conflict. Because they could 
		end to hunting the same deer, before they would launch their HUNT action, they must reach a consensus about
		what to do each other.

		\item[Utility based]

		Goal-based models are a dycothomic approach that rely on bivalued logics. A goal is considered
		achievable or not achievable, an agent is commited to a goal or is not commited to that goal. But
		many fields have shown things usually work in a fuzzy manner or probabilistically or with multivalued
		assignations. Mentioning some example, robot soccers. In a match, eventually, you could pass the 
		ball to a partner or try to score. If you launch the action “pass” things will happen different 
		from launching action “score” but a priori you cannot predict which will be of more help. And if 
		you stop to think about it the opponent will steal the ball from you. Another example, a fire
		simulation. There are many escape routes; when a route is saturated due to congestion, people 
		have a variable internal timeout wait time to leave the route and try another one. There is also 
		fuzzy phenomena in auctions; auction agents have to decide wheter raise the ``bet'' or leave.

		%TODO arrange
		An agent under these circumstances will find a set of available goals where each one produce a
		different benefit for the agent itself. The goals, the states of agent and environment must be 
		weighted in function of probability of success, or benefit for the agent. Also, there is some related
		optimization trend or related likelihood of achieving positive results. 

		%%Uncertainty(chap13 Russell... maybe ch16)
		A pure logical agent can find a cul-de-sac on its deductions if the possible contingencies overcome
		the reasoning to deduce the actions to fulfill the goal. These issues are what is called
		\textbf{uncertainty}. Uncertainty is the term used when there are many solutions that lead to the
		goal or if the goal is something not sure to be achieved and the agent faces a choice with no 
		success ensured. 

		For instance, considering a hunter agent in a social simulation of ancient societies, a hunt action
		can be affected by many issues. First you must make a guess about where the preys are. Once you 
		begin the hunting session many things could happen: a weather incident that changes prey grace
		behaviour, other hunters appear to hunt the preys, or dangerous roaming predators. The pure bivalued
		logic agent cannot predict the setbacks so cannot deduce the sucess of the action, and the hunt 
		action will not be launched leading to starvation. If all the logical paths towards the achievement 
		of the goal are troubled by contingencies the agent could fall in a loop of inactivity.\\ 
		When perfect solution is perhaps non achievable, the agent should be allowed to satisfy the goals
		through a non perfect solution. The decission engine should be changed to accept failable solutions 
		for its goal seeking. Another hunt area should be eligible in the decission process. But maybe,
		although the other area is free of contingencies, it cannot offer a good outcome because is almost
		dessertic. Someway the agent should express a \textbf{preference} and deduce the action planning
		according to it. Preference over the outcomes of and action in the goal seeking activities of the 
		agent encompass the modeling of success probability and benefit quantification. A particular outcome
		should be the fact that the hunter returned home without getting injured and a certain amount of 
		Kg. of meat. 

		\textbf{Utility theory} is used to represent and reason with preferences. Utility theory says that
		every state has a degree of usefulness, or utility, to an agent and that the agent will prefer 
		states with higher utility \cite{RussellNorvig}. Preference and similar issues are modeled through
		\textbf{utility functions}. 
			\begin{equation}
			 u\ :\ E \rightarrow \ \mathbb{R}
			\end{equation}
		Utility functions map desired states to a quantitative dimension, a scoring. Utility ponderation 
		allows to break ties in sub-goal selection. Utility functions will give extra heuristic information
		about the likelihood achieving a goal. If the hunter agent has acces to two areas of hunting, $valley$
		and $wood$ and is more likely to find dangerous predators in the $wood$ although the same preys can 
		be found on both areas, the utility function would assign greater utility to the $valley$.\\
		Preferences, as expressed with utility functions, are combined with probabilities in the general 
		theory of rational decisions called \textbf{decision theory}: \cite{RussellNorvig}
			\begin{equation}
			Decision\ theory = probability\ theory\ +\ utility\ theory .
			\end{equation}

		Utility-based agents are rational and follow the principle of \textbf{Maximum Expected Utility (MEU)}: 
		\textit{An agent is rational if and only if it chooses the action that yields the highest expected
		utility, averaged over all the possible outcomes of the action.}

\begin{description} 
	\item [Environment Features]
	\item [Accessible vs Inaccessible] An accessible environment is one in which the agent
		can obtain complete, accurate, up-to-date information about the environment’s state.
		Most moderately complex environments (including, for example, the everyday physical 
		world) are inaccessible.\\
		The more accessible an environment is, the simpler it is to build agents to operate in it.
		Accuracy and completeness about information retrieved is key to decission making.
		All the missing stretch must be supplied with uncertainty managing techniques.
	\item [Deterministic vs non-Deterministic] As we have already mentioned, a deterministic
		environment is one in which any action has a single guaranteed effect — there is no 
		uncertainty about the state that will result from performing an action.
		The physical world can to all intents and purposes be regarded as non-deterministic.
		Non-deterministic environments present greater problems for the agent designer.
	\item [Episodic vs non-Episodic] In an episodic environment, the performance of an
		agent is dependent on a number of discrete episodes, with no link between the performance
		of an agent in different scenarios. Episodic environments are simpler from the agent
		developer’s perspective because the agent can decide what action to perform based only 
		on the current episode — it need not reason about the interactions between this and future 
		episodes.
	\item [Static vs Dynamic] A static environment is one that can be assumed to remain unchanged 
		except by the performance of actions by the agent. A dynamic environment is one that has 
		other processes operating on it, and which hence changes in ways beyond the agent’s control.
		The physical world is a highly dynamic environment.
	\item [Discrete vs Continuous] An environment is discrete if there are a fixed, finite
		number of actions and percepts in it. Russell and Norvig give a chess game as 
		an example of a discrete environment, and taxi driving as an example of a continuous one.

\subsection{Emergence}
Emergence is the outcome of the parts of the system that due to the dynamics of the interactions of these parts. Emergence cannot be predicted from only the constituents and their addition, the feedback must be taken into consideration. Emergence is a global effect produced by local dynamics.  
There is potential for emergent phenomena, i.e., when: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Agent behaviour is non linear ( weight sum of variables), or is expressed with discontinuities, if-then rules in a categorical framework or in discrete non continous manner.
 \item Under memory phenomena, path-dependence, and hysteresis, non-markovian behavior, or temporal correlations, including learning and adaptation. 
 \item Heterogeneous interactions between agents.
 \item When there is unstability to perturbations although the system could be defined linearly.
\end{itemize}

\section{ABM}

%% definition - description

ABM is a modeling methodology that relies on a application engineering architecture called Multi Agent Systems from A.I.
 
Following the paradigm of ABM, systems to model are decomposed into entities called agents, which have their behaviour defined,  how affect or are affected by environment, and how they interact with the other agents. The main activity for agents is decision making. Each agent individually assesses the current state of the environment, taking into account the other agents, and in accordance with its objectives takes an action that runs against the system, the environment plus the agents that may be involved. The system runs on a constant loop of evaluations, decisions and actions of the agents that inhabit it.
This will lead to situations of iterated interactions between a set of agents in a framework of cooperation, coordination or competition. Although simple agents in such an interaction environment can  make emerge many complex patterns and be a good model of real world systems, the methodology considers also features like mind models, authomatic learning or evolution and natural selection in agents endowing the agents with enhanced adaptation.[Bonabeau 2002]  


\subsection{Benefits of ABM}
%TODO (ref. PNAS.org)
There are  some striking features that make ABM stand out from other paradigms or approaches. ABM copes with the simple and bottom constituents of social science implicated in the modelization of a system, hence it can sometimes allow to describe a system naturally. It is not easy to develop an agent, but you are working with a metaphor  with a structure and concepts that we have at hand everyday. So it is more manageable, natural to express things with that “language”. Also, it is more flexible in the modelization. And to finish enumeration, ABM captures emergent phenomena. ABM follows the arise of emergence from its definition, following the bottom-up generation of phenomena from the atomic constituents when the system is run.
Lets mention an example from Helbing,\cite{Helbing2000}; consider a fire escape situation in a confined space: a movie theatre or a concert hall. Let us assume that there is one exit available. How can one increase the outflow of people? Narrowing down the problem, one could ask: what is the effect of putting a column (a pillar) just before exit, slightly asymmetrically (for example, to the left of the exit), about 1 m away from the exit? Intuitively, one might think the column will slow down the outflow of people. However, ABM, backed by real-world experiments, indicates that the column regulates the flow, leading to fewer injured people and a significant increase in the flow, especially if one assumes that injured people cannot move and impede the flow. This result is an example of a \textbf{counterintuitive} consequence of an emergent phenomena: who would think of putting a column in front of an emergency exit? ABM captures that emergent phenomenon in a natural way.\\

ABM is most indicated for describing and simulating a system composed of “behavioral” entities. Whether one is attempting to describe a traffic jam, the stock market, voters, or how an organization works, ABM makes the model seem closer to reality. For example, it is more natural to describe how a party of hunters move in a terrain and circle their preys than to come up with the equations that govern the dynamics of the density of hunters. Because the density equations result from the behavior of hunters, the ABM approach will also enable the user to study aggregate properties.  

%TODO Pregunta al Xavi sobre això:
%	classical : social system → conceptualizations → person, people → abstractions (groups, social dynamics,...) → model the abstractions.
%	ABM : social system → conceptualizations → person, people → model the people.
%Classical : you need an extra step of inferited knowledge a priori

It is advisable, because it can be more natural and useful, to use ABM through the constituent units' activities under the next conditions.
\begin{enumeration} 
\item The behavior of individuals cannot be clearly defined through aggregate transition rates.
\item Individual behavior is complex. Everything can be done with equations, in principle, but the complexity of differential equations increases exponentially as the complexity of behavior increases. Describing complex individual behavior with equations becomes intractable. For instance, the individual copes with hysteresis, or there is heterogeneity in the set of behaviours or there are learning procedures and adaptability.
\item When the interactions between the agents are complex, nonlinear, discontinuous, or discrete (for example, when the behavior of an agent can be altered dramatically, even discontinuously, by other agents).
\item When space is crucial and the agents' positions are not fixed. Example: fire escape, trade, foraging in a stochastic spatial distribution of resources, traffic.
\item Activities are a more natural way of describing the system than processes.
\item Validation and calibration of the model through expert judgment is crucial. ABM is often the most appropriate way of describing what is actually happening in the real world, and the experts can easily “connect” to the model and have a feeling of “ownership”. 
\item Stochasticity applies to the agents' behavior. With ABM, sources of randomness are applied to the right places as opposed to a noise term added more or less arbitrarily to an aggregate equation. 
\begin{end}

Besides naturality in expressing models, ABM models are flexible. ABM can manage agents at different levels of aggregation. The decission units can be a person but also social entities like families, couples or tribes with their own rules for intearaction and behaviour. You can tune your model easily moving between different layers of abstraction from social sciences. ABM works with models where decission-making and aggregation is clearly separated. The range of complexity of the agent,  its behavior, degree of rationality, ability to learn and evolve, and rules of interactions can be tuned more independently of the range of complexity of the aggregation, individualality, and groups. This allows the modeller to work with different levels of description or complexity in the same model. %TODO ( explicar-ho mes???)

A last characteristic feature of agent computing, although not often noted, is that once a model has been created it provides not merely one aspect of the solution — the equilibria, say, or the stability — but rather entire solution trajectories.[Axtell2000]

\subsection{ABM issues}

What is mentioned in a past section as a benefit must be mentioned here because there is an other side of the coin.
While other methods return only the equilibria or optimality conditions, ABMs yield trajectories of the
system, allowing to retrieve more data to induce patterns or any other dynamics that could emerge. This has its
drawbacks. For a causality result to be stablished or a pattern to be detected many runs must be performed.
If a result R appears as an outcome of the model, how strong are the bond of the result and that model? How
much does have to change the model to loose R? For equational models there are analytical methods to answer
the question. With ABMs many runs must be launched varying the initial conditions, testing parameter sensibility
and other protocols from model validation. This leads to computational expensive experimental tests. 
You have to come to terms with a post phase of analisys which could be computationally expensive, although improvements
in current computer technology begins to lower the concern.
\cite{Axtell2000}

Other computational costs that encumber the model are the decission processes, even more if we talk about AI and Problem Solving techniques with intensive cpu consumption.%TODO un pel curt

		The software we will use to implement the model is the Pandora Library, created by the social simulation
		research group of the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre. This tool is designed to implement agent-based 
		models and to execute them in high-performance computing environments (Rubio and Cela, 2010). It has been 
		explicitly programmed to allow the execution of large-scale agent-based simulations, and it is capable of 
		dealing with thousands of agents developing complex actions. The tool used has full GIS support to cope 
		with simulations in which spatial coordinates are relevant, as in the case here, where we want to detect 
		and compare spatial patterns. This library also allows the researcher to execute several simulations by 
		modifying initial parameters, as well as to distribute particular executions with high computer costs by 
		using a computer cluster. A cluster is formed by different linked computers (called nodes); the distribution 
		divides the computing cost of the execution between different nodes, each of which executes a part of the 
		entire simulation. As a result we will be able to run the simulation in a fraction of the time that would 
		be needed if we were using a single computer. The results of each simulation are stored in hierarchical data 
		format (HDF5), a popular format that can be loaded by most GIS. This feature is particularly useful, as we 
		will also use GIS to analyse simulation results.

		Finally, Pandora is complemented by Cassandra, a program developed to analyse the results generated by a simulation created
		with the library.

\chapter{Gujarat Case Modelization} % ODD casi a pelo, comprovar les policies MDP,programmed,etc...
	\section{Introduction}
Northern Gujarat is a marginal environment between the Thar Desert and the more fertile area of Saurashtra. This region is an ecotone, characterized by the seasonal influence of the monsoon where contrasting ecological niches are in tension and small climatic shifts can generate significant environmental changes, eventually affecting  resource availability. Archaeological evidence points to the presence and possible coexistence in the area of groups of people with different resource management strategies and mobility behaviors: hunter-gatherers (HG); agropastoralists (AP); urban Harappans (UH).
The aim of this study is to model resource management and decision making among hunter-gatherer groups in this region to explore adaptive trajectories and performance in relation to a) environmental variability and b) the appearance of other specialized groups . 
What factors play a role in HG persistence or disappearance in arid margins? Is the advent of agro-pastoral behaviour a big enough change to explain the disappearance of HG behaviour? What happens when there is an external influence, such as that by UH? Does climate change affect HG behaviour?
	    \subsection{Hypotheses}
In our starting hypothesis HG groups are adapted to marked seasonality (due to monsoon) in the arid margins of northern Gujarat. We intend to explore HG resilience considering: a) the appearance of AP, b) the appearance of an external attractor (UH) and c) climate change. We define resilience as the ability of the system to maintain its identity in the face of internal change and external perturbation (Carpenter 2001).
