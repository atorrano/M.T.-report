\begin{abstract}
The aim of this master thesis is the development of a multiagent model for a simulation  of two populations whose interactions are strongly influenced by a realistic landscape.
This research will be in line with Consolider-Simulpast (www.simulpast.es), an interdisciplinary project aimed to create simulations designed to be used in archaeological studies of human-environment interaction, decision-making processes and coevolutionary/competition behaviours of past societies.
The work plan will be focused on the development of first-stage models for two societies in the age of agriculture spreading surpasing the hunting and foraging way of living. The simulation will involve a climate engine for seasonality depending primarily on variable rainfall rate. Landscape information will be created from satellite image rasters. Constants, and variable relationship shall be modelled from measures and interviews with the experts. Data analysis tasks will be undertaken to validate the models and detect patterns in the archaeological record. Furthermore a comparison will be stablished between the classical simple models used in social simulation[1][2][8] and more advanced approaches.

\section{Motivation}

Simulation has been following an evolution in the models and paradigms applied to represent its target
systems. Dynamical systems, differential equations have been used and an overall simplification of the parts of the systems in the history of simulation to operate with the abstraction and simplification of the problems.
Mainly, reusing ideas from physical simulations, social sciences has modelled complex systems with dynamical
atomic entities that apply a simple set of centralized rules to move around the environment modelled. It was seen that due to the deeper details in human behaviour the question that could be solved and asked to that kind of models could not go very further as expected. 

To solve non-linearity phenomena, heterogeneity, hysteressis and other issues typical of complex systems, Agent Based Models(ABMs) where introduced to gain more insight of the modelled systems achieving good results. But under 
some conditions of very complex relationships between agents, highly specialized decission taking procedures
and issues in the environment led agents to need a sophysticated reasoning and problem solving capabilities
that are not specified and not yet introduced in ABMs coming from Social Sciences. 

We have found an example of that situation in our case study located in Gujarat from Simulpast project. Our agents must interact with a regular but changing environment to get resources, plan its actions, coordinate with its group and compete with other groups in a \textbf{co-evolution} dynamic. Because we want to find out why the Gujarat HunterGatherer(HG) way of life lasted more than in other place of Earth in its competition against AgroPastoralist(AP), we need to embed the behaviours of the survival strategies used by these groups. A simply reactive agent cannot cope with short term plus long term decissions in that competitive environment. So the question stated as topic for this Master Thesis project is \textbf{``do we get better results in social sciences simulations adding deeper AI techniques to make richer the behaviour or decission making engines of the entities in the system?''}. As we understand ``better results``, the outcome from the use of AI should be a more sound validation of the model, a nearier match of modelled behaviours with the real ones, and clearer, richer and robust scientific conclusions.

In order to study such posibilities Sugarscape[SugarScape] is a good framework to extend. Sugarscape is an artificial society developed by Joshua Epstein et al[Epstein]. where a number of inhabitants move to collect resources they need to live. Sugarscape models perception, lattice scanning in search of resources, sexual reproduction of the agents in the simulation, market relationships, immunology and spreading of diseases, and feature evolution. Epstein analises different experiments executed in the Sugarscape offering his conclusions and the dynamics emerging from the simulations. The results and conclusions will feed our AI experiments in order to make the comparisons of classical SugarScape agents vs AI agents, therefore, giving an answer to the topic of the Master Project.

%brief description
%hi ha altres aplicacions de simulacio on no hi ha component temporal i no ho estic esmentant! MonteCarlo,etc...
Simulation is a discipline for performing virtual experiments in a computer. Computational techniques are used to build a model that represents your system. The dynamics of that system is codified in an algorithm that computes a calculus imitating the changes of state in the model, hence having a representation of that change along the time of the system modelled. Simulate is to play to ''what happens if...?'', and it is aimed to discover and explain the dynamics of a system to enhace or guide strategy development, decission taking, management, solving problems without analytical solutions or knowledge discovering and research. Although, we could get other positive benefits from it like theory checking or training through the inmersion in virtual worlds responding to our input.

% purpose, a priori, outcome,  { deduction, induction, abduction(Alexis) } Axelrod's
% crec que els agradara, marketing, saborcillo de IA impregnant els racons
A simulation obeys some direction of experimentation, so a question must be set to drive the selection of features to model from the real system and give a direction to the modelling and the experiments design.These assumptions choice will prune the details not related to the questions to solve. It is not just for the sake of simplicity but for the practical reason that a model too near of the real system will be as hard as the original system to analyse.\\
Simulation, like deduction, starts with a set of those explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, it does not prove theorems. Instead, a simulation generates data that can be analysed inductively. Unlike typical induction, however, the simulated data comes from a rigorously specified artificial experiment rather than direct measurement of the real world. While induction can be used to find patterns in data, and deduction can be used to find consequences of assumptions, simulation modeling can be used as an aid intuition and hypothesis validation tool ( also as space search mechanism for parameter tunning or optimization ).
%abduction
Just like in a tipical Sherlock Holmes adventure you pick the evidences, scenario for the experiment, and the common knowledge (initial expert assumptions about the model). You enter in a refinement cycle where you test hypothesis and readjust them to discover the theory, the ``plot``, the explanation of what is happening.

Social simulation is a research field that applies computational methods to study issues in the social sciences. The issues explored include problems in psychology, sociology, political science, economics, anthropology, geography, archaeology and linguistics \cite{TakahashiSallachRouchier2007}.\\
Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the hard sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.\\
In social simulation, computers supports human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as complex non-linear systems, which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models.
%reducibility 
Most of the times, studying complex systems implies to cope with non reducibility. One of the examples is Gravitational Dynamics. If our assumption is the use of Newton's mechanics, we can predict the state at any time or not, depending on the scenario. For a one dimension world you can predict the state at time $t_n$ from the initial state $t_0$ without computing all the preceding ones. For two and more dimensions you can only compute directly state $t_n$ if less the three bodies are implied. So in a real environment of many bodies in a 3D world you need to compute all the states from the initial to the one you consider as the last one. The system is non analytically reducible and you are forced to apply simulation to visit all the states and develop the behaviour of the model.
% ( Classical Physics formulae used are non linear, acceleration is a quadratic factor in position <-- revisa aquesta fantasmada ) 

%emergence
Other of the main issues in complex systems simulation is emergence. While the initial assumptions may be simple, the consequences may not be at all obvious. The large-scale effects of locally interacting entities are called "emergent properties" of the system. Emergent properties are often surprising because it can be hard to anticipate the full consequences of even simple forms of interaction. 

%why simulation? because I need this non deducible emergence and the non deducible end state
There are some models, however, in which emergent properties can be formally deduced. Good examples include the neo-classical economic models in which rational agents operating under powerful assumptions about the availability of information and the capability to optimize can achieve an efficient reallocation of resources among themselves through costless trading. But when the agents use \textbf{adaptive} rather than optimizing strategies, deducing the consequences is often impossible; simulation becomes necessary.

\section{Question} 

% trobo a faltar m\'es xixa te\`orica, aix\`o s'hauria de semblar m\'es a un cap\'itol del Norvig.
In classical simulation approaches, specifically in the branch of Social Simulation, active entities which model human actors are designed with very simple behaviour engines. The classical hypothesis is that a complex mind for entities in the simulation are not that needed and maybe even could lead to difficult analysis of final results of the simulations (too daring statement?). 

Our statement is that, on the contrary, the mind engine of a simulation entity should not be bounded to that limit but special attention must be paid to give any necessary sofistication to give the entity a correct behaviour, real enough, sensible to the changes in the environment and competent to solve the issues that will have to solve along its lifetime in the system. Even more, we think that this entities' capability to respond with complex behaviours is the core that roots the modelling granularity needed to catch the essential of the social systems that we want to model.( a l'apartat de ABMs ho tornem a dir perÃÂ² afegint que cal adaptabilitat, resposta no lineal, aprenentatge depenent del temps, histeresis,...).\\
( i aixo motivaria els ABMs) Applying such premises we will explore the possibility to give or enhance decission
making, problem solving capabilities to the entities with the aim to get more accurate simulations and realistic models with higher matching against our job hypothesis and premises. We will take the framework of ABMs to integrate the AI techniques in a decission making schema of action-response dynamics sensible to a modelled world(por los pelos...).\\

\\

%%% XR
Computer modelling and complex systems simulation have dominated the scientific debate over the last decade, providing important outcomes in biology, geology and life sciences, and resulting in the birth of entirely new disciplines (e.g. bioinformatics, geoinformatics, health informatics, etc.). In the social sciences, the number of groups currently developing research programs in this direction is increasing. The results are extremely promising since simulation technologies have the potential to become an essential tool in the field \cite{Gilbert2008}.\\
However, some social scientists are sceptical about the idea of reproducing âinsideâ a computer population dynamics, because of the perceived complexity of social structures. This scepticism is understandable given the low number of projects that used this approach and the lack of experience of social scientists with these tools. Nevertheless, the research done in complexity science during recent years shows the way computer simulation can be applied to this field. Artificial intelligence portrays how the appropriate interconnection of very simple computational mechanisms is able to show extraordinary complex patterns, and access to distributed computing has become affordable. For this reason, agent-based simulation allows the implementation of experiments and studies that would not be viable otherwise \cite{Pavon2008}. \\

% ATM mini intro
The concept of modelling is widely extended. It comes from the natural observation of the world and the curiosity or need to reproduce it.

Modelling will be our framework for communication between archeologists' and sociologists' knowledge and their conceptualizations with our formal representations from computer science practices( simulation, algorithms, AI ).
The reason is that it is a procedure that will help to communicate the \textbf{discursive} nature of Social Sciences with the formal structures from Computer Science. The enginering of model development will allow us to reach a connection from experts' knowledge to a model that comprises the set of detail clearing out the ambiguity that language could filtrate. Also, the model development cycle will help set a picture of the system without inconsistencies, with each fact sound,  coherent and consistent from the logical point of view with the whole. 

\section{Why model}

% ATM, que es modelar? i com es modela?
The modelling process consists in identifying separable entities, processes, relationships and any rellevant information related to the question to solve and the domain of study. Indeed just thinking about something implies an unconscious projection of our mental frame hence producing a set of concepts and relationships that give birth to a model. The missed step is that it was not made explicit through some formal representation.
As Epstein \cite{Epstein2008} says \textit{âAnyone who ventures a projection, or imagines how a social dynamicâan epidemic, war, or migrationâwould unfold is running some modelâ}.\\

Modelling is an introspection exercise where you take into account the domain to elaborate a \textbf{formal} representation of the conceptualizations you develop around the problem. Mainly, it will have to do with mathematical expressions from calculus or algebra and logics. That is called \textbf{conceptual modelling}. This phase comprises the development of a relevant simplification, which must be complete according to the phenomena that inspires the question. Anything left out will change the outcome of the simulation, and non-relevant added items will produce noise that will difficult posterior analisys. All the involved facts must be correctly well grounded taking into account that any unneeded compound in the model will also be added to the scientific and mathematic justification, adding good-for-nothing effort. \\

For instance, I am modelling the dynamics of a restaurant to find an optimum allocation of waiters between interior and terrace tables and their serving policy, so I could minimize hired waiters while lowering the waiting time of clients. Variables like client arrival rate, kitchen serving time, number of interior tables, number of terrace tables are reasonable parts of the system to add to the simplification. The colour of the courtains, the outfit of the waiters most probably will not account for the stated optimization objective. Someone could argue about the topology of the tables whether it should be added or not to the model. But if I would model the system to analyze the survival rate when there is a fire and people must exit from the building as soon as possible, table and furniture topology is an unquestionable variable.\\

This kind of criteria should lead to a preference for simpler models. There are many reasons which force to design consciously with this premise. More complex models require harder effort to work their credibility, verification for the correct implementation of the conceptual model, and from the formal point of view, validation of the model and the scientific conclussions. Considering the system conceptualization and formalization, a more complex model is more open to criticism for the objective or subjective choice of features and modelling decisions. Why the present features were chosen and the missing ones were left out? why one expert point of view, and not other one? Also, as Robinson \cite{Robinson2008} states, simple models have many advantages, such as they are faster, require less data, are more flexible and, more importantly, if we better understand them we can better interpret their results. The KISS Lemma sumarizes it ``Keep It Simple, Stupid''.\\
% ATM:aqui o mes endevant? aprofondir molt?
At this point how do we construct the model?\\
	Top-down?\\
	Bottom-up?\\
	Consider a set of subsystems\\
		explore them enable/disable pressence\\
		add increasing complexity subsystems : eg. Agent Policy\\

%George Box
Although good modelling of the parts could be accomplished lefting out the non-relevant phenomena, quoting George Box, the model will be wrong, what matters is whether it will be useful for us or not.\\

% multidiscpl ATM
As said before, Social Sciences represent their knowledge in discursive texts using natural language. In our case we are experiencing interaction between different disciplines of social sciences : anthropology, archeology, and sociology. Each one of these branches has its own terminology, argue their discurse with different structures. 
Besides having to cope with implicit ambiguity in each discursive knowledge, all these branches must be merged in a common framework connecting the different used conceptualizations. Some branches can organize their knowledge in concepts of entities, other use processes or actions, for instance. We cannot collapse this frameworks directly in a model. The modelling process will ellicite this structures and will match them with the mathematical tools offered by the chosen paradigm( lets say Dynamical System Theory, Agent Based Models, Petri Nets ). We will translate the conceptualizations to a common language that will connect the formalizations in a whole, the textbf{conceptual framework}.  
Modelling will help to find a consensus for expressing the concepts and properties, will help to ellicite knowledge, arrange ambiguities, detect common points. It will allow as to embed the needed rigor to work under the same framework to make every part work together ( aixo sona fatxa i centralista :P ). Modelling shall be an exercise of shared development that can approach positions and circle a communication problem to solve the issues that will arise.

	\section{ABM}

ABM's. ABM's should be seen more as a metaphor (es una tecnica, no una metafora) than a methodology.

An ABM is build from some atomic identified entities in a bottom up design procedure.\\
Such entities are active decission making actors in the modelled system. The modelling lifecycle of an ABM will consider a stage where decission making processes must be identified from the system. Usually that decission making 
actions are carried along by more or less clear individual entities from the system. The modelling process will take the task to set the matching between these entities and the agent that will conform the ABM. The concept 
'' agent '' condenses a set of features that will specify the modelling metaphor that an agent represents:
some enclosed set of mechanisms to be aware of the state of the system, a set of goals to accomplish and the engine to decide from a bounded perception of the world, the actions to apply on it to achieve these goals. Besides the reasoning component of the agents, ABMs have a strong component of inter-agent relationship. How one agent interacts with other agents could as important or more as how it reacts to world changes.
\\
bottom-up approach, reductionist way of looking at the things, we try to understand the parts\\
to join them from their relationship and then we try to get the big picture.

		The software we will use to implement the model is the Pandora Library, created by the social simulation
		research group of the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre. This tool is designed to implement agent-based 
		models and to execute them in high-performance computing environments (Rubio and Cela, 2010). It has been 
		explicitly programmed to allow the execution of large-scale agent-based simulations, and it is capable of 
		dealing with thousands of agents developing complex actions. The tool used has full GIS support to cope 
		with simulations in which spatial coordinates are relevant, as in the case here, where we want to detect 
		and compare spatial patterns. This library also allows the researcher to execute several simulations by 
		modifying initial parameters, as well as to distribute particular executions with high computer costs by 
		using a computer cluster. A cluster is formed by different linked computers (called nodes); the distribution 
		divides the computing cost of the execution between different nodes, each of which executes a part of the 
		entire simulation. As a result we will be able to run the simulation in a fraction of the time that would 
		be needed if we were using a single computer. The results of each simulation are stored in hierarchical data 
		format (HDF5), a popular format that can be loaded by most GIS. This feature is particularly useful, as we 
		will also use GIS to analyse simulation results.

		Finally, Pandora is complemented by Cassandra, a program developed to analyse the results generated by a simulation created
		with the library.

\chapter{Gujarat Case Modelization} % ODD casi a pelo, comprovar les policies MDP,programmed,etc...
	\section{Introduction}
Northern Gujarat is a marginal environment between the Thar Desert and the more fertile area of Saurashtra. This region is an ecotone, characterized by the seasonal influence of the monsoon where contrasting ecological niches are in tension and small climatic shifts can generate significant environmental changes, eventually affecting  resource availability. Archaeological evidence points to the presence and possible coexistence in the area of groups of people with different resource management strategies and mobility behaviors: hunter-gatherers (HG); agropastoralists (AP); urban Harappans (UH).
The aim of this study is to model resource management and decision making among hunter-gatherer groups in this region to explore adaptive trajectories and performance in relation to a) environmental variability and b) the appearance of other specialized groups . 
What factors play a role in HG persistence or disappearance in arid margins? Is the advent of agro-pastoral behaviour a big enough change to explain the disappearance of HG behaviour? What happens when there is an external influence, such as that by UH? Does climate change affect HG behaviour?
	    \subsection{Hypotheses}
In our starting hypothesis HG groups are adapted to marked seasonality (due to monsoon) in the arid margins of northern Gujarat. We intend to explore HG resilience considering: a) the appearance of AP, b) the appearance of an external attractor (UH) and c) climate change. We define resilience as the ability of the system to maintain its identity in the face of internal change and external perturbation (Carpenter 2001).
